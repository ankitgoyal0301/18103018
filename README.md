- **Assignment 2:**

1. Write a java program to compare two strings lexicographically (without using library function).  
2. Write a program to implement counting sort (with input in the range 0 to 20 and input can be repeated multiple times)  
3. Write a program to sort strings (without using library function).  
4. Find the smallest n such that Σi = i2 where 1 ≤ i ≤ n is too large to be represented as an int.  
5. Let us define a couple of sets of integers, and let Java compute the set-theoretical operations (union, intersection and complement). We first fix our universe, which will consist of the 11 elements, Universe = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, A and B will be entered by users.  
a. Only array can be used as data structure  
b. Using any efficient data-structure available in Java  
c. Compare the time to compute the operations  
6. Write a ConsoleProgram that reads in a number from the user and then displays the Hailstone sequence for that number (Pick some positive integer and call it n. If n is even, divide it by two. If n is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Continue this process until n is equal to one

- **Assignment 3:**

A) To implement a program (Web scrapper) in Java that take as input any URL say http://pec.ac.in and do following things. 
1. It sends the request (http request) for the URL supplied. 
2. Get the page and extract all the text and html tags present in the page. 
3. Extracted text along with tags should be sent to an Excel file like <p> || welcome to pec (both in separate columns). 
4. Paste the extracted anchor tags i.e. </a> and the URLs in a separate file along-with the text so this excel with have two columns <text in anchor> <corresponding URL>. 

B) You can use String/ StringBuffer/ String Builder class function to perform the above operations 

C) Try to change the crawler developed above to Focused Web crawler. By crawling only those webpages that have information regarding any faculty of that institute.  

D) Devise a method to handle downloadable data present in the website like PDF, word links etc.
